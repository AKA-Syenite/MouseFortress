The general syntax for defining menus is like so:

Name|Parent|Flag,Another Flag,Yet Another Flag

With name being the displayed name of the menu, parent being the menu it's under (if any), if you'd like to
define the menu as a topmost menu, simply leave the parent field blank. Flags are defined in the final field,
and are comma-seperated. Note how each field is seperated by a |.

The syntax for defining keys is like so:

Key(s)|Flag,Another Flag,Yet Another Flag

With key(s) being the hotkey or hotkey combination you want to use to activate the hotkey.

http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm and http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm explain the different hotkey
possibilities that you can use in the key field.

Any options or additional parameters for a flag are defined in parenthesis () after the string, eg: p(g) or ru(h)
You can define as many flags as you'd like, and they will execute in the order in which they appear.

Modifiers are as follows:
+ - Shift
^ - Control
! - Alt
# - Windows key
& - Used to join two keys (For example Numpad0 & Numpad1)
~ - Passes the original keystroke on to the sytem
